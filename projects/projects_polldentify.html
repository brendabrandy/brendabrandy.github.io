					<p> To create a super smart web app that traces the historical and current sources of pollution for a given geographical location using US wind and pollution data  </p>

					<h3>Introduction </h3>
					<p> Air pollution has been a topic of debate and discussion ever since the 1990s. As people become more and more aware of their actions to the environment, they are also becoming more vigilante about the air that they breathe in. We often refer to weather reports for a better understanding of the air quality and the concentration of pollutants. For future research purposes, all these pollutant information are well-recorded in some databse in the US government along with other weather details in the past 20 years. </p>

					<p>
					POLLDENTIFY aims to analyze these pollutant records from weather stations to generate new insights about the air around us. Through using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_dispersion_modeling#Gaussian_air_pollutant_dispersion_equation"> Gaussian Dispersion Model </a> -- a model commonly used by national weather stations for weather forecasting and by other government agencies for decision making -- we analyzed 137 sample points in the United States to track the source of pollution on each sample point monthly for the past 15 years. We gathered and processed approximately one hundred thousand sample points in total.
